 Now let's compile it:

`g++ -c main.cpp`

In case you installed SFML to a non-standard path, you'll need to tell the compiler where to find the SFML headers (.hpp files):

`g++ -c main.cpp -I<sfml-install-path>/include`

Here, <sfml-install-path> is the directory where you copied SFML, for example /home/me/sfml.

You must then link the compiled file to the SFML libraries in order to get the final executable. SFML is made of 5 modules (system, window, graphics, network and audio), and there's one library for each of them.
To link an SFML library, you must add "-lsfml-xxx" to your command line, for example "-lsfml-graphics" for the graphics module (the "lib" prefix and the ".so" extension of the library file name must be omitted).

`g++ main.o -o sfml-app -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system`

If you installed SFML to a non-standard path, you'll need to tell the linker where to find the SFML libraries (.so files):

`g++ main.o -o sfml-app -L<sfml-install-path>/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system`

We are now ready to execute the compiled program:

`./sfml-app`
